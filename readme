The TMDICE program allows to simulate jets of strongly interacting particles that evolve in the QGP medium 
undergoing processes of coherent medium induced emissions as well as scatterings off medium particles. 
Furthermore the possibility that the jets first undergo processes of vacuum like emissions (VLEs) in the medium 
was added.

Requirements for usage:

In order to compile and run the entire code of this repository a Linux operating system with an installed 
C++ compiler of the GNU-Compiler collection is required. This compiler is g++ for the C++ standard C++11 
or higher. So far, other compilers have not been tested.

Instructions for the usage:

In order to use the code in the present form for the generation of jets without underlying hard collisions, 
download the files of this github-repository into a folder, which is referred to as <folder> from now on, 
and grant permissions to execute the code file. Then, the code needs to be compiled via running the 
following command within a terminal window:

<folder>/run.sh

After compilation, the program can be run via executing the following command within a terminal window:

<folder>/a.out <file>

where <file> is the location of the newly created output file.

Both physical and numerical parameters can be changed in the file named "inputfile".

In order to include TMDICE as a library in another C++ program add the following line at the beginning 
of the program code:

#include "TMDICE.h"

Also the other .cpp and .tpp files, with the exception of "runtmdice.cpp" need to be compiled together 
with the project.
